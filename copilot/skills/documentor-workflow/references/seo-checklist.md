### Description quality checklist

- [ ] 120-165 characters
- [ ] Includes call-to-action
- [ ] Different from title
- [ ] Different from H1
- [ ] Uses active voice

## H1 Heading

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Case | **Sentence case** (NOT title case) |
| Primary keyword | Include in the H1 |
| Gerunds | No -ing words |
| Uniqueness | Can overlap with title but should not be identical |
| Count | Exactly one H1 per article |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> H1 uses **sentence case** while title uses **title case**. This is a common mistake — subheadings also use sentence case.

## Intro Paragraph

| Length | 2-3 sentences recommended |

| Rule | Requirement |

| Gerunds | Avoid -ing words |
| Standard headings | Preserve template headings: Prerequisites, Related content, Next steps |
| Hierarchy | No skipped levels (H2 → H3 → H4) |
| Periods | No periods at the end of headings |

### Standard headings to preserve

These headings are part of the Azure docs template and must be kept as-is:
- Prerequisites
- Related content

- Overview (for product-overview articles)

## Image Alt Text

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Length | 40-150 characters |

## Internal Linking

| Rule | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Relative links | Use relative paths for links within the same docset |
| Anchor text | Use descriptive text, not "click here" or "this article" |
| Related content | Include 3-5 related links in the Related content section |
| Next steps | Include 1-3 actionable next steps with links |
