# ADO Work Items

A VS Code Copilot skill for creating and validating Azure DevOps work items that comply with Azure Core Content Standards.

---

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | How to verify |
|-------------|---------------|
| **VS Code** (1.100+) | `code --version` |
| **GitHub Copilot** (agent mode) | Copilot Chat → mode dropdown → "Agent" available |
| **ADO MCP Server** | Check MCP config for `ado-content` server entry |

---

## Installation

Copy the `ado-work-items/` folder to your Copilot skills directory:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse .\ado-work-items\ "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\skills\ado-work-items"
```

Restart VS Code.

### Folder structure

```
ado-work-items/
├── SKILL.md
├── README.md
└── assets/
    └── ado-work-item-standards.prompt.md
```

### Cross-skill dependencies

| Dependency | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `_shared/` | No direct dependency |
| `sources/` | Repo URL lookup — resolves GitHub clone URLs from the repository catalog |
| `my-workflow/references/repos.md` | Curated active repo list for quick reference |

---

## Usage

Open **GitHub Copilot Chat** in agent mode.

### Create a work item

> "Create a work item for Load Balancer freshness review"

The agent will:
1. Ask for the service name and workflow type
2. Collect answers for the 4 required sections (customer problem, solution, success, metrics)
3. Ask about an associated GitHub PR
4. Set default dates (start = today, due = end of month)
5. Generate the work item for your review

### Validate an existing work item

> "Validate work item 554937"

The agent will:
1. Retrieve the work item from ADO
2. Check all 4 required sections are present and well-written
3. Verify dates and GitHub PR links
4. Report gaps and suggest improvements

### Repo URL lookup

When a work item references a GitHub repo or article path, the skill resolves clone URLs from the sources catalog at `copilot/skills/sources/`. Use per-org YAML files (`MicrosoftDocs.yml`, `Azure.yml`) or category files (`azure-networking.yml`) to find the correct repo.

## Required description sections

Every work item must include:

1. **Customer problem to solve** — stated from the customer's perspective
2. **How you'll solve the problem** — specific files, approach, source of truth
3. **What does success look like?** — customer outcome, not a checklist item
4. **How will you measure success?** — concrete metrics (CSS ticket reduction, feedback improvement)

---

## Quality standards

- Sentence casing for headings
- No internal jargon in customer-facing problem statements
- Specific file paths in the solution section
- Measurable outcomes in success metrics
- Markdown format for all ADO fields (`format: "markdown"`)
- `cda` tag always included for tracking
