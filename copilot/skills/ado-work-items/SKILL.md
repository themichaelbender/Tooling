# ADO Work Items Skill

Create and validate Azure DevOps work items that comply with Azure Core Content Standards.

## When to use

- Creating new User Story work items for content work
- Validating existing work items for completeness and quality
- Standardizing work item descriptions across the team

## Workflows

| # | Workflow | When to use | Output |
|---|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | **Create Work Item** | New content task (freshness, new article, rewrite, etc.) | ADO work item with templates applied |
| 2 | **Validate Work Item** | Check existing work item for completeness | Gap analysis + improvement suggestions |

## Required fields

Every work item must have these fields populated:

| Field | Work item type | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Title** | All | Short description that immediately conveys the work |
| **State** | All | Current status (New → Committed → Active → Review → Closed / Removed) |
| **Area** | All | Correct area path for your team (for queries and boards) |
| **Iteration** | All | Correct iteration/sprint (for queries and sprint boards) |
| **Description** | All | Customer problem, solution, success criteria, measurement plan |
| **Tags** | All | Classify the work (see Tags section below) |
| **Story Points** | User Stories | Level of effort estimate |
| **Tee Shirt Size** | Features | Estimated level of effort (S/M/L/XL) |
| **Parent** | All | Epic or Feature this work item belongs to |
| **Development** | User Stories | Link to PR; use `AZ#<id>` in GitHub to auto-link |

## Required description sections

Every work item description must include:

1. **Customer problem to solve** — from the customer's perspective
2. **How you'll solve the problem** — specific files and approach
3. **What does success look like?** — customer outcome
4. **How will you measure success?** — concrete metrics

## Feature vs User Story

- **Feature**: Larger body of work spanning multiple sprints. M1s or content devs create these. Dependency Tracker items are always Features — leave them as Features even if they don't span multiple sprints.
- **User Story**: Smaller unit of work completable within one sprint. If work will extend past one sprint, create a Feature and divide into child User Stories.

## Work item hierarchy

Content Portfolio → Initiative → Epic → Feature → User Story → Task

| Level | Owner | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Content Portfolio | M2 | Aligned with CSA |
| Initiative | M2 | Aligned to Content Team priorities |
| Epic | M1 | Semester-level guiding work |
| Feature | M1 or IC | Multi-sprint work with context |
| User Story | IC | Single-sprint deliverable |
| Task | IC | Granular sub-steps of a User Story |

## Workflow states

| State | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| **New** | Initial state; triage and gather details. Move back here if work stalls. |
| **Committed** | Enough detail to schedule; planned for current sprint but not yet started. |
| **Active** | Work has begun. Only items in the current sprint should be Active. |
| **Review** | Draft complete; soliciting stakeholder feedback. May bounce between Active ↔ Review. |
| **Closed** | Acceptance criteria met. Don't close if no action was taken. |
| **Removed** | Out of scope, not actionable, duplicate, or won't be done. Terminal state — include context for why. |

## Story points

Use story points consistently so the team can estimate capacity. If you don't know how much work a User Story will take, create a research work item to scope it first. A User Story should span one sprint — if it won't, break it into multiple User Stories under a Feature.

## Repo URL lookup

When a work item references a GitHub repo or article path, resolve the repo URL from the sources catalog at `copilot/skills/sources/`. Use the per-org YAML files (`MicrosoftDocs.yml`, `Azure.yml`) to find the correct clone URL, or use `my-workflow/references/repos.md` for the curated active repos.

## Title format

`{Service} | {WorkflowType} | {Brief Description}`

Example: `Load Balancer | Maintenance | Github Issues & PR Review`

## Tags

Always include: service tag (e.g., `azure-load-balancer`), area tag (e.g., `Networking`), workflow type (e.g., `content-maintenance`), and `cda`.

### ACC team required tags

| Tag | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `content-maintenance` | Content health improvements |
| `mvp-feedback` | Updates from MVP feedback |
| `AAC` | Architecture center content |
| `new-feature` | New feature content |
| `PM-enablement` | PM enablement activity (>2 hours) |
| `css-support` | Content gaps/updates from CSS signals |
| `acc-horizontal-*` | Horizontal initiatives (replace `*` with security, reliability, supportability) |
| `curation` | Content curation activity |
| `CSAT` | CSAT initiatives |
| `Linux` | Improving Linux content |
| `content-gap` | Gaps in current content portfolio |
| `Process` | Process activities |
| `Training` | Training content updates |

Check with your manager for additional service-specific tags.

## Sprint planning

- Prioritize and commit to the highest-priority backlog items based on team velocity and capacity.
- Don't simply move unfinished items to the next sprint — reflect on why and whether to re-scope, re-prioritize, or break up the work.
- When changing an iteration path, add a comment explaining why.

## Work completion summary

Every ADO work item must include a **Summary of work completed** section before closing. This section provides a metrics table that quantifies the work delivered. Add this section to the work item description when the work is done.

### Required metrics table

```markdown
## Summary of work completed

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total PRs | |
| PRs reviewed | |
| Articles created | |
| Articles updated | |
| PRs merged | |
| PRs closed (not merged) | |
| Total files changed | |
| Total line changes | |
```

- Fill in every row; use `0` when a metric does not apply.
- Use `~` prefix for approximate counts (e.g., `~466`).
- Derive counts from the linked GitHub PRs whenever possible.

## Prompt asset

| File | Workflow |
|------|----------|
| `assets/ado-work-item-standards.prompt.md` | Create & Validate |
