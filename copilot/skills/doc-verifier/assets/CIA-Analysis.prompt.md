# Customer Incidents Analysis (CIA) Report

Generate a comprehensive Customer Incidents Analysis report for the specified **Azure Service Area or Product/Feature**. The report should mirror the structure and depth of an internal Microsoft CSS (Customer Service and Support) incident analysis, identifying recurring patterns, high-impact issue categories, and documentation gaps that can drive targeted content projects.

## Inputs

The user will provide one or more of:
- **Service Area**: A broad Azure domain (e.g., "Azure Networking", "Azure Compute", "Azure Storage", "Azure Identity")
- **Product/Feature**: A specific service or feature (e.g., "Application Gateway", "Azure Front Door", "AKS", "Cosmos DB")

If only a Service Area is provided, identify the top services within that area and analyze each. If a specific Product/Feature is provided, focus the analysis on that service.

## Source Rules

### Allowed Sources (use in priority order)
1. **learn.microsoft.com** — Official docs, troubleshooting guides, known issues, service limits
2. **azure.microsoft.com** — Service pages, SLAs, status history, update announcements
3. **techcommunity.microsoft.com** — Official blog posts, incident retrospectives, best practices
4. **devblogs.microsoft.com** — Engineering team blogs, postmortems, feature announcements
5. **github.com/microsoft** and **github.com/Azure** — Official repos, issue trackers, samples
6. **azure.status.microsoft** — Service health and incident history
7. **developer.microsoft.com** — Platform docs, SDKs

### Research Strategy
- Search for common errors, troubleshooting articles, and known issues for each service
- Look for "troubleshoot", "common errors", "known issues", "FAQ", "limits", and "quotas" pages
- Search tech community and dev blogs for incident retrospectives and pattern analysis
- Check GitHub issue trackers for recurring community-reported problems
- Review documentation feedback signals (if referenced in docs)

## Report Structure

Generate the report as a Markdown file with the following sections. Use tables, bullet lists, and clear headings throughout.

### 1. Executive Summary
Write a concise overview that includes:
- The service area or product analyzed
- Analysis period (state data is based on publicly available documentation as of the current date)
- 4–6 key findings as bullet points summarizing the most impactful patterns

### 2. Customer Incident Distribution by Service
If analyzing a Service Area with multiple services, create a ranked table:

| Rank | Service | Relative Incident Volume (Est.) | Primary Issue Categories |
|------|---------|---------------------------------|--------------------------|

- Estimate relative volume based on the breadth of troubleshooting content, known issues pages, and community discussion volume
- List the top 3 issue categories for each service
- Note: Clearly state that volume estimates are inferred from public documentation signals, not internal telemetry

If analyzing a single Product/Feature, skip the ranking table and go directly to issue categories.

### 3. Incident Trends & Notable Patterns
Identify and describe:
- Any documented outages, service incidents, or breaking changes in the analysis period
- Seasonal or release-driven patterns (e.g., spikes after major updates)
- Persistent issues that appear across multiple troubleshooting articles
- Reference specific Azure status incidents or blog posts where possible

### 4. Top Customer Issue Categories
Identify and rank the top 6–8 issue categories. For each category provide:
- **Category name** (e.g., Configuration Errors, Connectivity Failures, SSL/TLS Issues)
- **Description**: What the issue involves
- **Affected services/features**: Which parts of the service area are impacted
- **Common symptoms**: What customers typically report
- **Root causes**: The underlying reasons based on documentation

Format as numbered subsections with bullet details under each.

### 5. Service-Specific Customer Pain Points
For each service or major feature, create a subsection listing:
- The top 3–5 pain points based on troubleshooting docs and known issues
- Specific error codes or error messages where documented
- Links to relevant official troubleshooting pages

### 6. Documentation & Content Opportunities
Create two priority tiers:

**Priority 1: Critical Gaps** — Table format:

| Service | Documentation Need | Customer Impact | Priority |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------|----------|

**Priority 2: High-Value Content** — Bullet list of recommended guides, playbooks, or tutorials that would reduce incident volume.

Base these on gaps identified between common issues and available documentation coverage.

### 7. Trending Issues & Emerging Patterns
Identify 4–6 emerging themes such as:
- Increasing complexity in configuration
- Common cross-service failure points
- Areas where customers lack observability or monitoring guidance
- Shift patterns (e.g., migration-related issues, new feature adoption friction)

### 8. Recommendations for Documentation Projects
Organize recommendations by quarter or priority phase:
- **Immediate (next quarter)**: Top 3 documentation projects to address critical gaps
- **Near-term (next 2 quarters)**: 4–6 projects for high-value content
- Include the target service, content type (guide, tutorial, troubleshooting, reference), and expected impact

### 9. Success Metrics & Measurement
Propose a measurement table:

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Method |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|

Suggest realistic metrics such as:
- Reduction in support ticket volume for specific issue categories
- Improvement in time-to-resolution (TTR)
- Documentation satisfaction scores
- Page view and engagement metrics for new content

### 10. Data Sources & Methodology
List all sources consulted during the analysis, including:
- Specific documentation pages reviewed
- Blog posts and announcements referenced
- GitHub repos or issues examined
- Clearly state the methodology: publicly available documentation analysis, not internal telemetry

### 11. Conclusion & Immediate Action Items
Summarize 4–6 concrete next steps, focusing on:
- The highest-impact documentation projects
- Cross-service themes to address
- Partnerships or feedback loops to establish (e.g., CSS collaboration, product team alignment)

## Output Instructions

- Save the report as a Markdown file named `{ServiceArea-or-Product}-incident-analysis.md` in the current workspace
- Use proper Markdown formatting with headers, tables, and bullet lists
- Include `[Insert image: ...]` placeholders where charts or visualizations would add value
- Every factual claim must cite an official Microsoft source with a URL
- Clearly distinguish between **documented facts** and **inferred estimates**
- Use professional, objective tone appropriate for an internal Microsoft report
- If insufficient data is found for a section, note the gap explicitly rather than fabricating data
