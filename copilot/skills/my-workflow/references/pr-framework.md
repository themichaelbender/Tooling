## Examples by workflow type

### New article

```markdown
## Article intent

This article helps network engineers and architects at small and midsize organizations
build a secure-by-default Azure network foundation using a minimal hub-spoke topology.
It explains what each network security component does, how the components fit together
in a layered architecture, and why each design decision matters — without providing
detailed step-by-step deployment instructions, which are available elsewhere.

## Description of work

New concept article covering a layered hub-spoke network security pattern for regional
web applications in Azure. The article addresses:

- **Hub-spoke topology** — Hub VNet with shared services (Bastion, optional Firewall),
  spoke VNet with Application Gateway WAF and workload compute
- **Layered deployment order** — 10-step deployment sequence with dependency reasoning
- **VNet and subnet planning** — CIDR guidance, required subnet names and sizes
- **NSG segmentation** — Default-deny rules on every subnet, service-specific ports
- **DDoS Protection decision framework** — Network Protection vs IP Protection tier guidance
- **Application Gateway with WAF** — WAF policy migration, Detection vs Prevention mode
- **Azure Bastion** — PaaS vs IaaS decision, hub placement for multi-spoke reuse
- **Azure Firewall (optional)** — Basic SKU for SMBs, UDR routing, management subnet
- **Common mistakes and troubleshooting** — Anti-patterns table and fix guidance

### Freshness review / content maintenance

```markdown
## Article intent

This update ensures the Azure Load Balancer health probe documentation reflects current
best practices, accurate portal screenshots, and correct CLI/PowerShell commands for
customers configuring custom health probes.

## Description of work

Freshness review of the health probe configuration article:

- **Updated screenshots** — New Azure portal UI as of March 2026
- **Fixed CLI commands** — Corrected `--probe-protocol` parameter values
- **Added TCP health probe guidance** — New section on TCP probe intervals per SKU
- **Removed deprecated references** — Removed Basic SKU probe limitations (Basic retired)

### Files
- `articles/load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview.md` — Updated
- `articles/load-balancer/media/health-probes/portal-config.png` — Updated screenshot

AB#554321
```

### Bug fix / quick edit

```markdown
## Article intent

Fixes incorrect subnet size recommendation in the NAT Gateway documentation that could
cause customers to under-provision their NAT gateway subnet.

## Description of work

- **Fixed subnet CIDR recommendation** — Changed /28 to /27 per current guidance
- **Updated cross-reference** — Pointed to correct VNet planning article

### Files
- `articles/nat-gateway/nat-gateway-resource.md` — Updated
